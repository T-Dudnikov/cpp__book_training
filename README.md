# cpp__book_training
This is a repository where i try to work through the book Principles and Practice using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup. 
I will try to complete all examples from it with writing down answers and code samples.
For now i dont know how to actually control github and git overall, my english is kinda with translator mostly, and i have no idea how to organize this course. Plan to find out as i go.
